# CapstoneProject
Project created for the capstone requirement of the Carroll University Computer Science Degree.

I used this requirement as an opportunity to learn new technologies. Primarily C# and Unity. The project was to create a basic, working first-person shooter level 
while learning how C# is used with the Unity engine.
